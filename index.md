I am a Macroeconomist and Data Scientist at [QGRL](http://qgrl.ch) in Switzerland.

My Doctorate in Economics is from the SÃ£o Paulo School of Economics ([FGV](http://economics-sp.fgv.br/)). 
My research interests are Monetary Policy, Asset Pricing and Financial Risk Management.

### Projects 

1. [ARDL](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ardl/) is a R package to estimate Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag models. I am using this in Macroeconomic models.

2. [Ip2as](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ip2as/) is a Pyhon 2.7 package to analyze ipv4 traffic and classify it according to their origin network, as indicated by their ASN (Autonomous System Number). This is networking engineering stuff from a previous life.

3. [Statistics with R](http://www.statr.org/) proposes a practical approach to learning Statistics and basic Econometrics using R, a free and amazing tool with an fast-growing user base. Here you find the fundamental concepts that future Data Scientists must grasp before diving into Machine Learning (ML) and Econometric methods. 

4. [Analyx](http://analyx.ch/) is a Machine Learning research group. It's a meeting point to learn/teach and prepare to enter ML competitions. 

### Working Papers 

1. "Automated News Reading in R using the [newsminer](https://github.com/fcbarbi/newsminer/) package" (2017, under submission)

2. "Notes on [DSGE](https://github.com/fcbarbi/dsge/) Model Design and Estimation" (2017, under development) 

3. "Does FDI matter for Sustainable Growth in Sub Saharan Africa ? Evidence from a Heterogeneous Panel" (2016 [pdf](https://github.com/fcbarbi/research/blob/master/FDI_Sustainable_Growth_SSA_2016.pdf))

4. "Bayesian Forecasting of Interest Rates: Do Priors Matter?" (2014 [pdf](https://github.com/fcbarbi/research/blob/master/Bayesian_forecasting_interest_rates_do_priors_matter.pdf))
