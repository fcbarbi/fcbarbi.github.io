## Fernando C. Barbi

I am currently an entrepreneur in Switzerland where I teach **Project+Product Management** and **Scrum** at [PMWizards.com](https://www.pmwizards.com). I also coach teams in applying **agile methodologies** (Lean Management, eXtreme Programming and Test-Driven Development) and I advise companies on adopting **business agility**. 

My professional career started as a C/C++ developer, then Project Manager, Scrum Master, Product Owner and more recently Product Manager. 

As a **data scientist** I break codes hidden in large amounts of data. I decode data looking for patterns to spot **causality** and **trends**. I enjoy telling the **story behind the numbers**, to make them tell us their secrets, either by putting them in context or by exposing their lies, shining light on the truth.

I use Econometrics and Machine Learning tools to research on **Blockchain** Kryptoeconomics and **Macro-Finance** models. 

As a developer at heart I enjoy coding in Python and Javascript. I love **R** for research, **Matlab** for Economic's DSGE modeling and **[TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org)** for developing Machine Learning models.

Before coming to Swizterland I lived in Brazil where I successfully started and run two companies, a *software house* and an *internet service provider*. 

I have a Doctorate in Economics from the SÃ£o Paulo School of Economics ([FGV](http://economics-sp.fgv.br/)) focused on Monetary Policy, Asset Pricing and Financial Risk Management. 

I am on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcbarbi/) and on [Ideas](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pba724.html).

My primary contact is **fcbarbi AT gmail DOT com**

Projects 
--------

* [ARDL](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ardl/) is a R package to estimate Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag models. I am using this in Macroeconomic models.

* [Ip2as](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ip2as/) is a Pyhon 2.7 package to analyze ipv4 traffic and classify it according to their origin network, as indicated by their ASN (Autonomous System Number). This is networking engineering stuff from a previous life.

Working Papers 
--------------

* "Does FDI matter for Sustainable Growth in Sub Saharan Africa ? Evidence from a Heterogeneous Panel" ([2016](https://github.com/fcbarbi/research/blob/master/FDI_Sustainable_Growth_SSA_2016.pdf))

* "Bayesian Forecasting of Interest Rates: Do Priors Matter?" ([2014](https://github.com/fcbarbi/research/blob/master/Bayesian_forecasting_interest_rates_do_priors_matter.pdf))

Teaching Notes
--------------

1. [Basic Statistics in R](https://github.com/fcbarbi/statR/) proposes a practical approach to learning Statistics and basic Econometrics using R. (under development) 

2. [DSGE Design and Estimation](https://github.com/fcbarbi/dsge/) (under development)
