### Projects 

1. [ARDL](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ardl) is a R package to estimate Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag models.

2. [IP2AS](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ip2as) is a Pyhon 2.7 package to analyze ipv4 traffic and classify it according to their origin network, as indicated by their ASN (Autonomous System Number).

3. [Statistics with R](http://www.statr.org) proposes a practical approach to learning Statistics and basic Econometrics using R, a free and amazing tool with an fast-growing user base. Here you find the fundamental concepts that Data Scientist candidates must grasp before diving into Machine Learning (ML) and Econometric methods. 

4. [Tech Tutorials](http://www.quantclass.com) Some practical field notes on Agile development, SQL/BigQuery, NoSQ/MongoDBL, Scala, Spark, Hadoop, R, Python, C++, UML and continuous self-education. The idea is to provide a channel to exchange experiences and improve our skills, together.

5. [analyx.ch](http://analyx.ch) is a Machine Learning Research Group. It can be a meeting point for people to prepare to enter ML competitions (such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)). 

6. On-line training on Project Management ([GestaoDeProjeto.info](http://www.gestaodeprojeto.info)), Risk Management ([GestaoDeRisco.info](http://www.gestaoderisco.info)), Derivatives ([derivativos.info](http://www.derivativos.info)) and Mathematics for Finance ([MatematicaFinanceira.info](http://www.matematicafinanceira.info)), all in Portuguese.
