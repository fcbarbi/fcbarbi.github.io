## Fernando C. Barbi

I am a researcher at the [CEF-SBS](https://www.sbs.edu/community/center-for-entrepreneurial-finance/), the **Center for Entrepreneurial Finance** at the **SBS Swiss Business School** in Zurich, and a product manager developing tools for **Private Equity** investors. 

As a **data scientist** I break codes hidden in large amounts of data. I decode data looking for patterns to spot **causality** and **trends**. I enjoy telling the **story behind the numbers**, to make them tell us their secrets, either by putting them in context or by exposing their lies, shining light on the truth.

I use Econometrics and Machine Learning tools to research on **Blockchain** Kryptoeconomics and **Macro-Finance** models. 

I got a Doctorate from the SÃ£o Paulo School of Economics ([FGV](http://economics-sp.fgv.br/)) researching Monetary Policy, Asset Pricing and Financial Risk Management. 

I am here on [GitHub](https://github.com/fcbarbi), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcbarbi/) and on [Ideas](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pba724.html).

My primary contact is **fcbarbi AT gmail DOT com**

Projects 
--------

* [ARDL](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ardl/) is a R package to estimate Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag models. I am using this in Macroeconomic models.

* [Ip2as](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ip2as/) is a Pyhon 2.7 package to analyze ipv4 traffic and classify it according to their origin network, as indicated by their ASN (Autonomous System Number). This is networking engineering stuff from a previous life.

Working Papers 
--------------

* "Does FDI matter for Sustainable Growth in Sub Saharan Africa ? Evidence from a Heterogeneous Panel" ([2016](https://github.com/fcbarbi/research/blob/master/FDI_Sustainable_Growth_SSA_2016.pdf))

* "Bayesian Forecasting of Interest Rates: Do Priors Matter?" ([2014](https://github.com/fcbarbi/research/blob/master/Bayesian_forecasting_interest_rates_do_priors_matter.pdf))
