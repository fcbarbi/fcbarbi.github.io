## Fernando C. Barbi

I am a Macroeconomist at [QG Research Lab](https://quantumglobalgroup.com/) and a Data Scientist for [AnalyX Research](http://www.analyx.ch) a Start-up in Zug, Switzerland.

My current research areas are Blockchain economics and Macro-Finance. I use Econometric and Machine Learning models to predict key economic and finance indicators (GDP, inflation and prices - or SDF, Stochastic Discount Factors, to be more precise).  
My Doctorate in Economics is from the SÃ£o Paulo School of Economics ([FGV](http://economics-sp.fgv.br/)). 
My research interests are Monetary Policy, Asset Pricing and Financial Risk Management. 

I am here on [GitHub](https://github.com/fcbarbi), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcbarbi/) and on [Ideas](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pba724.html).

Projects 
--------

1. [ARDL](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ardl/) is a R package to estimate Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag models. I am using this in Macroeconomic models.

2. "Automated news collection with the [newsminer](https://github.com/fcbarbi/newsminer/) R package" (2017, under submission)

3. [Ip2as](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ip2as/) is a Pyhon 2.7 package to analyze ipv4 traffic and classify it according to their origin network, as indicated by their ASN (Autonomous System Number). This is networking engineering stuff from a previous life.

Working Papers 
--------------

1. "Does FDI matter for Sustainable Growth in Sub Saharan Africa ? Evidence from a Heterogeneous Panel" ([2016](https://github.com/fcbarbi/research/blob/master/FDI_Sustainable_Growth_SSA_2016.pdf))

2. "Bayesian Forecasting of Interest Rates: Do Priors Matter?" ([2014](https://github.com/fcbarbi/research/blob/master/Bayesian_forecasting_interest_rates_do_priors_matter.pdf))

Teaching Notes
--------------

1. [Basic Statistics in R](https://github.com/fcbarbi/statR/) proposes a practical approach to learning Statistics and basic Econometrics using R. (under development) 

2. [DSGE Design and Estimation](https://github.com/fcbarbi/dsge/) (under development)
