1. [ARDL](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ardl/) is a R package to estimate Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag models. I am using this in Macroeconomic models.

2. [Ip2as](https://github.com/fcbarbi/ip2as/) is a Pyhon 2.7 package to analyze ipv4 traffic and classify it according to their origin network, as indicated by their ASN (Autonomous System Number). This is networking engineering stuff from a previous life.

3. [Analyx](http://analyx.ch/) is a Quantitative Methods research group. It's a meeting point to learn/teach and prepare to enter Machine Learning competitions.
